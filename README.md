# Py IDE

Py IDE is a basic IDE for Linux and Mac (if you use Windows, don't) written in Python3 and using GTK3 libraries as GUI. It is inspired on Visual Studio for Mac (not VS Code) - released yesterday (November 16th 2016).

It will feature live Web Development preview, preset compiling options for C/C++ (screw Java) plus customizable compiling options for C/C++ and pretty much any other language since you can write your own compiling code, and any other nice feature that I can copy from some other decent IDE.

Right now it looks something like this:

## Features

Sort of works.

* Basic syntax highlighting
* Opening and saving files

## To-do

Literally everything.

Being developed right now:

* Menu button featuring settings menu, new file and folder creation, manual syntax highlighting language setting, and more.
* Real time external files/folders creation detection (update and add them to the Tree View)

## FAQ*

\*Actually never asked questions that you might be asking yourself right now

__What theme is that?__

That is Arc Flatabulous, best theme ever (yes it has a dark version).
